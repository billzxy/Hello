1. JavaScript vs. Python:

I would prefer Python. (I have never learned JavaScript.)
JavaScript borrows a lot from C, and it is mostly used for scripts on websites.
Whereas Python could be applied to a lot of different areas. And, in my opinion,
Python is easier.

2. PHP vs. Ruby:

I have never learned both.
Ruby is easier? (Some others' opinions)
So I think Ruby is better.


3. Java vs. C++:
C++ takes more time to learn. And Java-programmers is in greater demand.
So Java is better.

4. C++ vs. Python:
C++ is harder than Python. (At least CS1124 is harder than CS1114.)
But I still prefet C++. Because I've found C++ more suitable for OOP.
And C++ is challenging.

5. Compiler(E.g. C) vs. Interpreter(E.g. Basic):
I think interpretive languages are easier to learn.(Sounds like it.)
But I prefer compiler because it is more efficient.
Rather than interpret-one-line-then-run-one-line, compiler compiles all of
the lines and run all lines at the same time.

6.
Scripting languages, for example JavaScript, are used basically on "apps,
web sites, web browsers, shells, and embedded systems"(from wikipedia).
They are interpretive languages.               

7. Gaming:
C++ is prefered for game development. Because C++ is more suitable for OOP.
So it is better for development of big projects.

8 Website:
Scripting languages like PHP and JavaScript are for backend development.
Whereas frontend development requires skills in Dreamweaver, Frontpage, Flash,
and Photoshop.
